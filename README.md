# Easy Shuffle Widget

The Easy Shuffle Widget is a fun way to feature any content on your site.  It's an easy-to-use WordPress widget that displays random content by shuffling through your site's posts, authors, custom post types, and comments, and choosing one at random.

Want to only shuffle through comments or posts?  No problem!  You can choose to shuffle through _any_ content, or the content of your choice.

## Developer Features

This widget was built not only with end-users in mind, but also plugin developers.  Almost every aspect of this widget is extensible through filters and action hooks.  You can even add your own form fields to the widget form!
