== Description ==

_Keep em' guessing!_

The Easy Shuffle Widget is a fun way to feature any content on your site.  It's an easy-to-use widget that displays random content by shuffling through your site's posts, authors, custom post types, and comments, and choosing one at random.

Want to only shuffle through comments or posts?  No problem!  You can choose to shuffle through _any_ content, or the content of your choice.


__Features__

* Configurable widget title.
* Set up multiple instances.
* Select which content to display.  (You can choose either any registered post type, users, comments, or full-on random.)
* Supports post thumbnails and user avatars.
* Set _and preview_ custom thumbnail sizes.
* Show an excerpt of the post, comment, or author description.
* Set _and preview_ the length of the excerpt.
* Choose the default (basic) CSS styling or roll your own.

__Developer Features__

This widget was built not only with end-users in mind, but also plugin developers.  Almost every aspect of this widget is extensible through filters and action hooks.  You can even add your own form fields to the widget form!

* Need to remove a field from the widget form?  Not a problem!  Every field is passed through its own filter for easy customization.
* Need to modify the output of the widget?  Easy!  The output is passed through numerous filters, allowing you to customize the content to meet your project's requirements.
* For a full list of action hooks and filters, please see the plugin documentation: http://darrinb.com/plugins/easy-shuffle-widget
